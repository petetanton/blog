Hi, I'm Pete, a Software Engineer at the BBC working within the Media Services team.

I studied Audio Acoustics at The University of Salford with a dissertation focusing on 3d audio broadcasting for music.

I have worked as a freelance sound engineer and as a Streaming Operations Engineer before I joined the BBC in 2015.

I am passionate about building highly reliable and scalable broadcasting systems for IP.
